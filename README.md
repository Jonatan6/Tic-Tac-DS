Tic Tac DS is a small game that I programmed for the Nintendo DS in C.

Currently it has 2 modes: *Multiplayer* and *CPU Battle*, The CPU has 3 difficulties.

## Compiling
To compile this program you need DevkitPro with DevkitArm and libnds. I recommend that you use the makefile that I have included.
